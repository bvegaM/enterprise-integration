## üèôÔ∏è Problem

The company XYZ has had a constant growth, from having one office to 20 offices throughout the country, in addition to opening presence on platforms to massify their products and attract more customers using Facebook and WhatsApp for businesses, where it has also had a great reception; they use the commercial version in the cloud of the manufacturer of Odoo, reducing the problems of slowness and intermittency that had between the different offices, in order to manage in an appropriate way to the large number of customers that the company currently has, they have used the CRM module with good results.

Due to commercial relations, the company became part of a consortium or group with the purpose of generating business among the companies of the group, so that within the group there are specialized companies to manage customer profiles according to the customer's purchasing preference.

* Company XYZ has already profiled its customers through the CRM module.
* Company 123 is a company specialized in managing customers whose online shopping profile are customers who make all their transactions only through digital channels.
* The ABC company specializes in handling customers who, although they are approached online, prefer to make their purchases and transactions through face-to-face channels such as offices.

An online solution is needed to pass XYZ company customers to 123 and ABC companies according to the customer's purchase channel profile, 123 and ABC companies use different information systems or platforms, they have developed a web service to receive customer information from XYZ company, they have agreed to exchange the information in JSON form.

Develop a proof-of-concept solution that allows to create a scenario that simulates the environment described above, using an integration framework as well as an integration pattern that allows to transmit customer information.

## üíª Development

### Main process : `enterprise-xyz-integration`
![Spring](https://img.shields.io/badge/spring-%236DB33F.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=spring&logoColor=white)
![Apache Maven](https://img.shields.io/badge/Apache%20Maven-C71A36?style=for-the-badge&logo=Apache%20Maven&logoColor=white)

This project contains the main process of transferring information to the services of the companies `abc` and `123`. To perform this integration we used the `apache camel` framework with spring boot.


Additional swagger was used which is opened in the following link `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` with the objective of accessing the client transfer service.

### First service : `enterprise-abc-integration`
![NestJS](https://img.shields.io/badge/nestjs-%23E0234E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=nestjs&logoColor=white)
![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/NPM-%23CB3837.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm&logoColor=white)


This project contains the webservice to register `abc`digital and office customers and is developed in `NestJs` framework. For the moment and for practical purposes, this webservice only saves the information in memory, so when restarting the whole project the information will be lost.

### Second service: `enterprise-123-integration`
![FastAPI](https://img.shields.io/badge/FastAPI-005571?style=for-the-badge&logo=fastapi)

This project contains the webservice to register `123` digital customers and is developed in `Fast API` framework. For the moment and for practical purposes, this webservice only saves the information in memory, so when restarting the whole project the information will be lost.
